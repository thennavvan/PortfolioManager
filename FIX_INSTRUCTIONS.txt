# Fix Instructions

## To fix the three issues, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Start the Python Yahoo Finance Service
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
cd c:\Users\Administrator\PortfolioManager\YahooLivePrice
python app.py
```
Wait until you see: "Starting Yahoo Finance price service on port 8000"

### Step 2: Rebuild and Restart the Spring Boot Backend
Open another terminal and run:
```bash
cd c:\Users\Administrator\PortfolioManager\PortfolioManager
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Wait until you see: "Started PortfolioManagerApplication"

### Step 3: Refresh the Frontend
Go to http://localhost:3000 and refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)

## What was fixed:

1. **Asset 400 Error Fixed**: 
   - Added `name` field to the POST request (was missing from frontend)
   - The backend requires both `symbol` and `name` fields

2. **Live Price N/A Fixed**: 
   - Updated PriceResponse DTO to have a no-arg constructor for JSON deserialization
   - Added setter methods for proper JSON mapping
   - Updated frontend to use `price` instead of `currentPrice`
   - Improved Python app error handling and response format

3. **Dashboard 0 Values**: 
   - This will show data once you add at least one asset
   - The Python service must be running for price fetching to work
   - Try adding AAPL or MSFT as a test asset

## Testing:
1. Add an asset: AAPL, Stock, Qty: 10, Price: 150
2. Go to Holdings - should show your asset with live price
3. Go to Live Prices - search for AAPL or MSFT
4. Go to Dashboard - should show totals and allocation chart
